## What
Information Relay Integrity System or IRIS for short is a real time client-server infrastructure monitoring and reaction tool designed to fight against Ransomware attacks and advanced persistent threats.


## Why
Not every company can afford a fully developed security team. Not every Administrator wants to set up their own automation. Tools today are often times either outdated, overpriced, non-customizable, or not the perfect fit. But with IRIS's extensive customizability and open source nature I hope that you can find a place for IRIS where other tools may fail or come up short.

So, IRIS is here to provide a small lending hand to those Sys-Admins. With the use of a very powerful API users will be able to modify IRIS, break it, and make it stronger.

## Programs and features

### Pylon Real-Time historical comparison monitor (come up with a better name)
By using randomly scattered files called "Pylons" and getting the checksum of those Pylons to send back to the monitor server, if an automated ransomware attack is running rampant and hits one of the Pylons the server will be alerted. From there sys admins have the option to set reaction settings on a per-node basis. Reactions may include changing permissions to stop non-admin users from changing files, sending out an email to desired addresses, making API calls to non-IRIS infrastructure (i.e. automated SMS system, a logging server, etc.), Injecting a custom script, etc.

### Nurse
Nurse is designed to be a quick and easy way to view how hard systems are running as well as show other usage stats and display them in an easily legible way so that data can be grouped up together in graphs on a page. Lots of people have already done it, but this is just meant to be a convenience that is built in to the IRIS Suite. 

## When
Currently this is just being built in free time outside of my personal occupation, so I do not have any set deadlines.


## Growth
### This system will surely grow and change. Here are some of my thoughts right now and how I may want to implement these additions...
