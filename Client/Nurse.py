# Nurse is designed to be a quick and easy way to view how hard systems are
#     running as well as show other usage stats and display them in an easily
#     legible way so that data can be grouped up together in graphs on a page.
#     Lots of people have already done it, but this is just meant to be a
#     convenience that is built in to the IRIS Suite.
