# Pylons

## What is this
This is a directory that contains some basic pylons to be deployed by creator.

## Supported file types
These files will be designed to hide in plain sight (how much so will be configurable, of course). So common file types for businesses will be created and distributed.

* .docx
* .html
* .jpg
* .pdf
* .png
* .txt

## Planning
Down the road I plan on creating randomized common document-type files to obfuscate the pylons that exist so that a ransomware attack could not deliberately skip the pylons.

To do this I plan on most likely importing 3rd party tools to write these document types.

I plan on also having the application or api server create these documents and then transfer them down to the client as to decrease performance load on the clients
